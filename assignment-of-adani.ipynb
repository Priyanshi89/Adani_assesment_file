visited the area to inspect the damage.\\nThe waters breached a retaining wall, flooding many commercial properties on Victoria Street - the main shopping thoroughfare.\\nJeanette Tate, who owns the Cinnamon Cafe which was badly affected, said she could not fault the multi-agency response once the flood hit.\\nHowever, she said more preventative work could have been carried out to ensure the retaining wall did not fail.\\n\"It is difficult but I do think there is so much publicity for Dumfries and the Nith - and I totally appreciate that - but it is almost like we\\'re neglected or

out?\"\\nMeanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain.\\nPeebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area.\\nScottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs.\\nThe Labour Party\\'s deputy Scottish leader Alex

that \"immediate steps\" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans.\\nHave you been affected by flooding in Dumfries and Galloway or
